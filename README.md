# NativeCo
In today's global food system, a significant disconnect exists between local producers of native seeds and their potential market, including restaurants and urban consumers. This disconnection leads to multiple challenges: an alarming increase in food waste, a decline in biodiversity due to the underutilization of native seeds, and a missed opportunity for promoting sustainable agriculture practices. Furthermore, the lack of an efficient platform for direct trade between local producers and buyers exacerbates these issues, contributing to unnecessary environmental degradation and impacting public health negatively. The extinction of native seeds not only affects indigenous communities and soil health but also undermines global efforts to achieve sustainability and resilience in food systems. The absence of a seamless digital marketplace hinders the preservation of biodiversity, efficient trade, and the education of communities on sustainable practices. NativeCo aims to address these critical issues by creating a digital solution that connects local producers directly with restaurants and consumers, promoting the utilization of native seeds, reducing food waste, and supporting sustainable agriculture, thereby contributing significantly to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals related to sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption, life on land, and good health and well-being.

At NativeCo, our commitment to creating a sustainable, equitable world is defined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 11, 12 and 15, specifically targeting sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption, life on land, and good health and well-being. Our targets, 3.8, 11.4, 12.3 and 15.5 drive our mission to bridge the gap between local producers and markets, addressing the critical issues of food waste, loss of biodiversity, and public health. Our choice of these goals and targets was inspired by our observation of the lack of communication between local food production and consumer access, leading to unnecessary waste and the endangering of native seeds‚Äîa situation that not only threatens indigenous practices and soil health but also undermines the potential for urban areas to benefit from fresh, sustainable produce.

In response, NativeCo leverages innovative technology to foster a digital marketplace that encourages direct engagement between producers and restaurants. This approach not only aims to minimize food waste but also supports sustainable agriculture practices. By integrating Gemini, we further enhance the efficiency of trade and educate our users on sustainable practices, making our platform a pivotal tool for achieving our targeted SDGs. Through NativeCo, we aspire to cultivate a more sustainable, healthy, and equitable world, showcasing the power of technology in solving critical environmental and public health challenges.

Join us in strengthening the future of food sustainability with NativeCo.

Our main product is our Flutter application. In the near future, we will be releasing our Android, iOS and macOS applications to app stores!
